# Cronjob Writing rules

## CRONTAB FILE

Below is the format of the cronjob file in relation to its commands.

Cron jobs can also be edited with: ```crontab -e```

## Field Allowed Values

| Field          | Allowed Values   |
|----------------|------------------|
| minute         | 0-59             |
| hour           | 0-23             |
| day of month   | 1-31             |
| month          | 1-12 (or names)  |
| day of week    | 0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names) |

- A field may be an asterisk (`*`), which stands for "first to last" or "all".
- Ranges of numbers are allowed. Ranges are two numbers separated with a hyphen. The specified range is inclusive. For example, `8-11` specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10, and 11.
- Lists are allowed. A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by commas. Examples: `1,2,5,9`, `0-4,8-12`.
- Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges. Following a range with `/<number>` specifies skips of the number's value through the range. For example, `0-23/2` specifies command execution every other hour.
- Steps are also permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say "every two hours", just use `*/2`.
- Names can also be used for the "month" and "day of week" fields. Use the first three letters of the particular day or month (case doesnâ€™t matter). Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.

## Special Strings

Instead of the first five fields, one of eight special strings may appear:

| String      | Meaning                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `@reboot`   | Run once, at startup.                |
| `@yearly`   | Run once a year, "0 0 1 1 *".       |
| `@annually` | (same as `@yearly`)                  |
| `@monthly`  | Run once a month, "0 0 1 * *".      |
| `@weekly`   | Run once a week, "0 0 * * 0".       |
| `@daily`    | Run once a day, "0 0 * * *".        |
| `@midnight` | (same as `@daily`)                   |
| `@hourly`   | Run once an hour, "0 * * * *".      |
